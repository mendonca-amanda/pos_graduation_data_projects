# 📚 pos_graduation_data_projects

This repository contains a collection of data projects developed during my Post-Graduation in Data Analytics and Business.

Each project was designed to simulate real-world business problems using techniques such as data exploration, predictive modeling, statistical testing, customer segmentation, and business recommendations.

Every folder includes:

✅ The original PDF presentation  
✅ A README summarizing the project  
✅ (Soon) A cleaned and reproducible Jupyter Notebook when applicable
